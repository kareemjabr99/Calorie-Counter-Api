## Overview

Calorie Counter Api is a restful api for personal tracking of calories consumption that helps you track your daily consumption of calories and to see past items consumed.

## My process

  First, I started with the backend of the application and the setup pf the database, then i continued with inserting the main restful CRUD api functionalities then insterting some additional functionalites while testing all of them. After the backend, i started to implement the frontend and adding all the components i needed for the application with all the routing of different components, after that the design was done. Finally I linked all the backend with frontend adding the necessary functionalities for the link.

### Built with

- Spring Boot + Hibernate
- Angular Framework
- MySql
- Postman (testing)


### What I learned

  I learned to tackle all the important and necessary functionalities of Spring boot plus angular, while facing many difficulties in linking the backend and the frontend i managed to successfully link them and produce a lovely application

   This was a fun little excersise to promote me to do bigger things in the future.

   If you want to start the application and test it out yourself first you need to change the application.properties file in the resources folder with your own database and then you cant start the application by heading to the cc.angular folder in your terminal and type "ng serve".
